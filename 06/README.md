This problem was clearly a binary tree problem but for part one I wanted to see if I could solve it without making a tree.

The second part I needed a binary tree to solve it. I tried to make it an "n" tree in case there are more than two
planets orbiting 

Code for part two adapted from [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-distance-between-two-nodes-of-a-binary-tree/)
